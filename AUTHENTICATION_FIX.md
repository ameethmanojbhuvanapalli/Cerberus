# Authentication Loop Fix and Modular Architecture

This implementation resolves the critical authentication loop issue and introduces a clean, modular architecture for the Cerberus authentication system.

## Critical Bug Fixed

### Problem
The authentication system was stuck in a loop because Cerberus tried to authenticate itself when its own authentication prompts appeared.

### Root Cause
1. `AppLockService` added Cerberus to the locked apps list (`myPackageName`)
2. Only `BiometricPromptActivity` was filtered, missing other prompt activities

### Solution
1. **Removed self-authentication**: Cerberus is no longer added to locked apps
2. **Complete prompt filtering**: All authentication prompt activities are now filtered
3. **Enhanced detection**: Added `isCerberusPromptActivity()` helper method

## Modular Architecture

### Core Components
- **AuthenticationStateMachine**: Pure state management with thread safety
- **AuthenticationStateManager**: Coordinates state with business logic  
- **AuthenticationFlowController**: Controls authentication flows
- **AppLifecycleDetector**: Clean app lifecycle detection with debouncing

### Interface Abstractions
- `AuthStateListener`: State change notifications
- `AuthFlowListener`: Flow event notifications
- `AppLifecycleListener`: App lifecycle events
- `AuthenticationProvider`: Clean authenticator interface

### Benefits
- Single responsibility principle
- Dependency injection ready
- Unit testable components
- Improved error handling
- Comprehensive logging

## Testing
- Unit tests for all core components
- Integration test for authentication loop scenario
- Thread safety and listener management tests
- Comprehensive coverage of edge cases

## Backward Compatibility
All existing functionality is maintained through the `ModularAuthenticationService` which provides the same API while using the new modular components internally.
